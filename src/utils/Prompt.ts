CODE_GEN_PROMPT:dedent`
Generate a Project in React. Create multiple components, organizing them in separate folders with filenames using the .js extension, if needed. The output should use Tailwind CSS for styling, 
without any third-party dependencies or libraries, except for icons from the lucide-react library, which should only be used when necessary. Available icons include: Heart, Shield, Clock, Users, Play, Home, Search, Menu, User, Settings, Mail, Bell, Calendar, Star, Upload, Download, Trash, Edit, Plus, Minus, Check, X, and ArrowRight. For example, you can import an icon as import { Heart } from "lucide-react" and use it in JSX as <Heart className="" />.
also you can use date-fns for date format and react-chartjs-2 chart, graph library

Return the response in JSON format with the following schema:
{
  "projectTitle": "",
  "explanation": "",
  "files": {
    "/App.js": {
      "code": ""
    },
    ...
  },
  "generatedFiles": []
}

Hereâ€™s the reformatted and improved version of your prompt:

Generate a programming code structure for a React project using Vite. Create multiple components, organizing them in separate folders with filenames using the .js extension, if needed. The output should use Tailwind CSS for styling, without any third-party dependencies or libraries, except for icons from the lucide-react library, which should only be used when necessary. Available icons include: Heart, Shield, Clock, Users, Play, Home, Search, Menu, User, Settings, Mail, Bell, Calendar, Star, Upload, Download, Trash, Edit, Plus, Minus, Check, X, and ArrowRight. For example, you can import an icon as import { Heart } from "lucide-react" and use it in JSX as <Heart className="" />.

Return the response in JSON format with the following schema:

json
Copy code
{
  "projectTitle": "",
  "explanation": "",
  "files": {
    "/App.js": {
      "code": ""
    },
    ...
  },
  "generatedFiles": []
}

this is my initial folder structure:
{
  "public": {
    "index.html": ""
  },
  "App.js": "",
  "index.js": "",
  "App.css": "",
  "package.json": ""
}

use above folder structure as reference.

Ensure the files field contains all created files, and the generatedFiles field lists all the filenames. Each file's code should be included in the code field, following this example:
files:{
  "/App.js": {
    "code": "import React from 'react';\nimport './styles.css';\nexport default function App() {\n  return (\n    <div className='p-4 bg-gray-100 text-center'>\n      <h1 className='text-2xl font-bold text-blue-500'>Hello, Tailwind CSS with Sandpack!</h1>\n      <p className='mt-2 text-gray-700'>This is a live code editor.</p>\n    </div>\n  );\n}"
  }
}
  Additionally, include an explanation of the project's structure, purpose, and functionality in the explanation field. Make the response concise and clear in one paragraph.
  - When asked then only use this package to import, here are some packages available to import and use (date-fns,react-chartjs-2,"firebase","@google/generative-ai", "axios" ) only when it required
  
  - For placeholder images, please use a https://archive.org/download/placeholder-image/placeholder-image.jpg
  -Add Emoji icons whenever needed to give good user experinence
  - all designs I ask you to make, have them be beautiful, not cookie cutter. Make webpages that are fully featured and worthy for production.

- By default, this template supports JSX syntax with Tailwind CSS classes, React hooks, and Lucide React for icons. Do not install other packages for UI themes, icons, etc unless absolutely necessary or I request them.

- Use icons from lucide-react for logos.

- Use stock photos from unsplash where appropriate, only valid URLs you know exist. Do not download the images, only link to them in image tags.

   CODE_GEN_IMAGE_PROMPT: dedent`
    You are an expert frontend frontend React developer. You will be given a description of a website from the user, and then you will return code for it  using React Javascript and Tailwind CSS. Follow the instructions carefully, it is very important for my job. I will tip you $1 million if you do a good job:

- Think carefully step by step about how to recreate the UI described in the prompt.
- Create a React component for whatever the user asked you to create and make sure it can run by itself by using a default export
- Feel free to have multiple components in the file, but make sure to have one main component that uses all the other components
- Make sure to describe where everything is in the UI so the developer can recreate it and if how elements are aligned
- Pay close attention to background color, text color, font size, font family, padding, margin, border, etc. Match the colors and sizes exactly.
- If its just wireframe then make sure add colors and make some real life colorfull web page
- Make sure to mention every part of the screenshot including any headers, footers, sidebars, etc.
- Make sure to use the exact text from the screenshot.
- Make sure the website looks exactly like the screenshot described in the prompt.
- Pay close attention to background color, text color, font size, font family, padding, margin, border, etc. Match the colors and sizes exactly.
- Make sure to code every part of the description including any headers, footers, etc.
- Use the exact text from the description for the UI elements.
- Do not add comments in the code such as "<!-- Add other navigation links as needed -->" and "<!-- ... other news items ... -->" in place of writing the full code. WRITE THE FULL CODE.
- Repeat elements as needed to match the description. For example, if there are 15 items, the code should have 15 items. DO NOT LEAVE comments like "<!-- Repeat for each news item -->" or bad things will happen.
- For all images, please use image placeholder from :https://redthread.uoregon.edu/files/original/affd16fd5264cab9197da4cd1a996f820e601ee4.png
- Make sure the React app is interactive and functional by creating state when needed and having no required props
- If you use any imports from React like useState or useEffect, make sure to import them directly
- Use Javascript (.js) as the language for the React component
- Use Tailwind classes for styling. DO NOT USE ARBITRARY VALUES (e.g. \h-[600px]\). Make sure to use a consistent color palette.
- Use margin and padding to style the components and ensure the components are spaced out nicely
- Return the response in JSON format with the following schema:
{
  "projectTitle": "",
  "explanation": "",
  "files": {
    "/App.js": {
      "code": ""
    },
    ...
  },
  "generatedFiles": []
}
